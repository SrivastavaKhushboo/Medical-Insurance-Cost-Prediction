# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction

In this project I have conducted an analysis of a health insurance data. This includes a dataset representing insurance costs for individuals. It uses information such as age, sex, bmi, and smoking habits to determine the cost on the insurance company for that person. The idea is to present a machine learning model that predicts the cost with the highest accuracy. The data that I use is secondary data that I get from https://www.kaggle.com/. This data contains 1338 lines consisting of several variables, including age, sex, children, smoker, region, and charges. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the effect of several factors on insurance costs and predict the cost of health insurance. The analysis used is linear regression.
